      <p>
        My journey into the world of programming began in the 9th grade when I
        first coded in <span className="gold">Pascal</span>. During high school, I honed my skills by
        participating in informatics olympiads, where my passion for competition
        and thirst for knowledge led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science.
        I am currently completing my Master's in Software Development and
        Business Information Systems. Now, I am seeking a role that will help me
        evolve and showcase the skills I have acquired throughout my academic
        and extracurricular endeavors.
